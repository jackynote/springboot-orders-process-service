# Future Work Outline

## 1. Ensure Data Consistency
- **Objective**: Prevent race conditions and maintain consistent data when multiple users interact simultaneously.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement optimistic and pessimistic locking mechanisms.
    - Explore the use of Event Sourcing for eventual consistency.
    - Consider distributed transactions using the Saga pattern or two-phase commit.

## 2. Manage Queue Distribution Across Franchises
- **Objective**: Distribute queues efficiently across franchises and ensure each operates independently.
- **Tasks**:
    - Design a centralized queue management service.
    - Implement sharding strategies for queues by franchise.
    - Set up load balancing to handle high traffic and redirect queues accordingly.

## 3. Handle Simultaneous Orders
- **Objective**: Ensure the system handles multiple orders without conflicts.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement concurrency control with row-level locking or serializable isolation.
    - Add message queue systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to process orders sequentially.
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling for order placements.

## 4. Scale the System for Growth
- **Objective**: Build a system architecture that scales efficiently with increased user load.
- **Tasks**:
    - Adopt a microservices architecture to scale components independently.
    - Enable horizontal scaling through cloud-native solutions like Kubernetes.
    - Introduce caching mechanisms to offload frequent reads from the database.

## 5. Ensure High Availability and Fault Tolerance
- **Objective**: Keep the system operational during outages or service disruptions.
- **Tasks**:
    - Set up database replication and failover mechanisms.
    - Implement the circuit breaker pattern to manage service failures.
    - Ensure redundancy in critical services with automatic failover strategies.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging
- **Objective**: Maintain visibility into system performance and errors.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement centralized logging using tools like Datadog, Signoz,..
    - Set up monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch for system health.
    - Create alerts for key metrics and implement self-healing mechanisms.

## 7. Security and Data Privacy
- **Objective**: Protect customer data and ensure secure system operations.
- **Tasks**:
    - Enhance authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth2, 2FA).
    - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Ensure compliance with data regulations and set up audit logging.

## 8. Testing and Validation
- **Objective**: Thoroughly test and validate all components.
- **Tasks**:
    - Write unit and integration tests for key
